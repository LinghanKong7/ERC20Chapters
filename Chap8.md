```javascripts
function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool){
        _approve(msg.sender, spender, value);
        return true;
    }
```

When calling this function, the owner of the contract authorizes, or approves, the given address to withdraw instances of the token from the ownerâ€™s address.

Here, and in later snippets, you may see a variable msg . This is an implicit field provided by external applications such as wallets so that they can better interact with the contract. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) lets us use this field to store and process data given by the external application.

In this example, msg.sender is the address of the contract owner.
